    Q16: If demand for your services outstrips the number of RSEs, what causes this situation?
                                                                                                                     count  percentage
    Hiring processes are long-winded, so we're always behind the demand curve                                           21          58
    We lack the funding to make new positions available                                                                 12          33
    We can attract RSEs, but can't hire them because the salary and other benefits we can offer are not competitive      9          25
    We have funding, but we can't find RSEs to hire                                                                      7          19
