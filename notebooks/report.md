    Q16: If demand for your services outstrips the number of RSEs, what causes this situation?
    
                                                                                                                     count  percentage
    Hiring processes are long-winded, so we're always behind the demand curve                                           20          61
    We lack the funding to make new positions available                                                                 11          33
    We can attract RSEs, but can't hire them because the salary and other benefits we can offer are not competitive      9          27
    We have funding, but we can't find RSEs to hire                                                                      7          21

| Digital Humanities Group, Lancaster     | At our highest point we had 6 fulltime RSEs, but we have scaled back in recent years whilst focussing on developing PGT. The scaling back was done by not replacing staff who voluntarily left for better paid jobs. With PGT in place, we now plan to increase our RSE activities again, which will require an increase in personnel. In my view, arguing the case for staff in advance of demand is a big problem, because the unpredictable nature of funding makes planning difficult when the model is 100% cost recovery to cover the wage bill.                                                                                                                      |

| University of Oxford                    | We are currently applying for central university funds to allow us to hire new RSEs and bring the cost recovery target down to 80% for the next 5 years, and have 20% time for training + new project development. This looks likely to go through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Swansea Academy of Advanced Computing   | The timing of the survey finds the team in a state of flux. The structure of the Supercomputing Wales project, plus internal bureaucracy, made it challenging to bring in other funding into the team, or even maintain the size of the team as the project was extended. The end of the project has seen the team move from being in principle central, to being more directly funded by a single faculty, and with significant uncertainty about the future. The inability of the institution to fund more than 3–6 months into the future (sometimes with less than a month's notice before when contracts would otherwise end) has led to a significant loss of talent. |

| King's Digital Lab                      | Over last few years has been growing recognition at college level of the strategic importance of RSE capability.

| University of Leeds                     | We currently do not have a head of RSE at Leeds and report directly to the Head of Research IT.

| Research IT, Bristol                    | I wasn't clear if you wanted number just on the RSEs, there are other valuable staff in the team who support what we do, such as admin and sysadmin roles. I have included them in the numbers as they are integral to the functioning of the team.   
On question of expanding the team, there is an issue of overhead  - if it got any bigger it would need to be restructured. Also we are in a a bit of a chicken and egg situation, to grow we have to have an uncomfortably large pipeline and demonstrate we have more work than staff available, but that is stressful to staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| University of Bath                      | The RSE group is embedded in the Research Computing team at Bath, and the majority of group's resources have been utilised on broader Research Computing projects due to staff turnover in the Research Computing team, difficulty in recruiting and a lack of separation of the group from Research Computing team management. Whilst there is significant demand for RSEs, and funding in place on several projects, the team has not had the opportunity to work on these projects and recover costs. Only one of the RSEs in the group is in a central role, the rest are 1.0 FTE embedded on specific projects.                                                        |
| University of Bristol                   | I am noticing now that hiring is getting easier, although I am still seeing that industry positions are very attractive to existing staff. There is a major disconnect between the salary and career path possible in academia and what is possible in industry. Cost of living means that most academic posts are becoming less attractive. There are many structural problems and barriers with academia and research funding that make this problem hard to solve, especially as RSEs are already employed under better pay and conditions than PDRAs and many research fellows. The academic / public research system is very broken.                                   |

| University of Birmingham                | These answers reflect a complex situation. For example some posts aim at 100% cost recovery, some 80% and some 0% - depending on details from when they were hired. Also - we can only meet demand because we hardly advertise our services. We don't really know the true demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| University of Manchester                | Despite there being difficulties in hiring due to lower pay in the University sector, we have worked hard to remind people of the other benefits of working at a University that they don't get in the private sector which has worked quite well. Don't underestimate these. We have also found that people who are largely motivated by money aren't necessarily a good fit for the team anyway. Technical expertise off the shelf is also overrated and investing in your junior RSEs is important and a more viable option long term.                                                                                                                                   |

| QUB                                     | Group was founded with 2 RSE fellows.  We have progressed to hiring 3 year-long interns, 1 FTE in MAP and funding for 3x FTE RSEs in cybersecurity. We are also working with the Post Doctoral Research Development centre who are mapping non-traditional, but essential, roles in the Uni to ensure fair attribution of credit and work.  RSEs will fit into this, hopefully redefining already existing roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Roslin Franklin Institute               | This was filled in by Mark Basham (Science Director for AI) but should represent the RSE group as a whole, whose core leader is Laura Shemilt.

For growth, we have grown as quickly as possible over the last few years, and spin up time has really been the deciding factor for new recruitment, but we defiantly have challenges around recruitment, and I see that there will be challenges around space and funding for growth to hit the level of demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Alan Turing Institute                   | We're 34 people in post now, but have 10 people appointed but not yet started and approval to appoint 1 more. Numbers above are based on the 44 appointed staff. The unfilled post is  earmarked for another Junior. Demand for RSEs has exceeded supply since the team was founded in 2016 and we have grown every year except the first year of the pandemic. We've made 18 appointments this year but will be looking to maintain our current size over the next year as the Institute finalises its strategic plan for the next 5-10 years.                                                                                                                             |
| UCL                                     | We are not just an RSE group any more, but provide 4 professions collaborating on projects, teaching, etc. My answers above focus on those within the team who identify at least partially as RSEs. On the demand/supply question, we are also limited by ability to onboard staff and the rate of growth trajectory risk that the university is prepared to accept while offering all permanent posts. So we are now trying to reduce future demand to match a known growth curve rather than trying to chase ever growing demand!                                                                                                                                         |
