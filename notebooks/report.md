    Q16: If demand for your services outstrips the number of RSEs, what causes this situation?
    
                                                                                                                     count  percentage
    Hiring processes are long-winded, so we're always behind the demand curve                                           20          61

    We can attract RSEs, but can't hire them because the salary and other benefits we can offer are not competitive      9          27
    We have funding, but we can't find RSEs to hire                                                                      7          21
