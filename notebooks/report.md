    Q17: Roughly what percentage of your roles are open-ended/permanent?
    
    Preprocessing prior to number conversion
    - dropped empty values
    - replace All with 100%
    - replace values with the first number found in string
    - replace 50/50 with 50%
    - find the first number in the string (if any) and restrict the answer to that
    - convert to numeric as integers

## People's roles

Stacked bar chart that plots how many people are in the group now (Q9) with the bar made up of 
1. how many are more junior RSEs (Q11)

    How many people in your group are in a less senior role than a standard RSE (e.g. a junior RSE)?
    How many people in your group are in a more senior role than a standard RSE (i.e. typically receiving greater pay than a postdoctoral researcher)?
    
    Preprocessing responses to
    - drop the rows with nan in any of these columns
    - select only groups with more than one person
