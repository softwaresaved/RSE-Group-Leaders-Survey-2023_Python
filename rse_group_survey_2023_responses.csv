The Open University group existed some time back (no idea when, and I didn’t know about it then). Then the person who mainly ran it left apparently and it stopped. Then the person who had helped run it, joined my team and when I heard about it, I wanted to try and restart it. So I re-registered the group with you with the intention to restart it and try and get an OU wide group going. But I have not really had the time I would have liked to properly restart it. So apart from my team and one other, we are not really a group. I obtained an OU website address for it, but have not had time to create the website. I started a Teams group, but not many people are in it and no one else seems inclined to help me. My boss has now decided he does not want us branded as research software engineers. We are just software engineers, so we can work on other stuff apart from research within the faculty.
 
I have spent 20 years at the OU basically working purely as a research software engineer (until the last few years, when I became a manager). I feel very strongly that Research Software Engineering is an unrecognised, undervalued, skill set and so I really would like to organise this group. But the truth is, with no help, it is unlikely to get anywhere. But I am not giving up yet!
